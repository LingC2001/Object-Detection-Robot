# ECE4078_Lab_2022
Repository for labs of unit ECE4078 (Intelligent Robotics) offered in 2022

You will work in groups to develop a fruit searching robot. The groups will be assigned based on your answers to the CATME survey. There is also a [Pre-reqs knowledge quiz](https://lms.monash.edu/mod/quiz/view.php?id=10713718), please complete this before the CATME survey. More info about the lab project can be found on [Moodle](https://lms.monash.edu/course/view.php?id=139686&section=3).

You are not allowed to use information from the simulator back-end (e.g., true poses of objects extracted from Gazebo or information from the map generator script) or use ROS packages in your implementation. You are not allowed to teleport the robot or objects inside the simulator either. If you are found to do so you will get 0 for that milestone. Late submission penalty is 10% every work day on your mark for the milestone.

For each lab milestone, you will submit your code on Moodle. Each group needs to make one submission. If multiple people from the same group have made multiple submissions, the latest submission before the deadline will be graded. You will be asked to demonstrate your solution during the lab session in both the simulator (80% of your score) and the physical robot (20% of your score), in the week after a milestone. For example, M2 runs from Week 3 - 5, then your M2 will be marked on Week 6 and so on. We will implement a STRICT time limit with marking so make sure you have everything already when it is your turn to be marked. A marking schedule (order of the teams) and detailed instructions regarding marking will be released ~a week before marking.
